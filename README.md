# my_cinema
Finished PHP CRUD (CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE) project

It uses mysqli methods to create queries over a database with results displayed in HTML

It works only using a localhost (ex: LAMP for Ubuntu) and by importing the cinema.sql in a DB named 'cinema' with
phpMyAdmin or something similar

To navigate properly, launch index.html first then you're good to go !
